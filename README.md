#PawsTwit

This is a sample RoR app written by [Patrick][onpaws], primarily following the Ruby on Rails tutorial with my own CSS and front-end tweaks. Shoutout to Michael Hartl for his excellent guide. User authentication is tough and writing it from scratch rocks!

Heroku pushes are semi-regular.

Ruby developer?
if you work on this with RVM, run
rvm use --default 1.9.3
			#where 1.9.3 is your version
